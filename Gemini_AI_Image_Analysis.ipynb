Initially, I tried to tackle too much at once, leading to a fridge overflowing with slightly soggy salads and forgotten containers*  But I learned to start small – one or two meals at a time – and to focus on recipes that I genuinely enjoy*  Finding reusable containers that are microwave and freezer safe has been a game changer, too!\n> \n> \n> Now, meal prepping is a relaxing weekend ritual*  It's about taking control of my nutrition and ensuring I have healthy, delicious lunches and dinners ready to go, no matter how busy my week gets*  It saves money, reduces food waste, and honestly, just makes me feel more organized and in control*  If I can do it, so can you!  What are your favorite meal prep tips? Share them in the comments below!\n"
